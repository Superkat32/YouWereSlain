# You Were Slain...

### Customize the death screen unlike ever before!

You Were Slain is a Minecraft mod that allows you to edit elements of the death screen. There are a lot of features, such as:
- Terraria-styled respawn delay
- Hide the respawn and title screen button
- Change text colors
- Allow the text to fade in
- Hide your HUD upon death(then unhide it upon respawn)
- Change the death gradient colors(starting and ending colors)
- Send a chat message including your death coordinates to yourself
- And more!

You Were Slain was made because I wanted a Terraria-styled death screen, but it quickly spiraled into a death screen customization mod. The default settings are based on Terraria.

## Dependencies
