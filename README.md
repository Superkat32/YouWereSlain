# You Were Slain...

### Customize the death screen unlike ever before!

You Were Slain allows you to edit multiple elements of the death screen. There are lots of features, including:
- A Terraria-styled respawn delay
- Ability to change text colors
- Allow for the text to fade in
- Hide your HUD upon death, for more a more cinematic effect(it then unhides the HUD upon respawning)
- Hide the respawn and or title screen buttons
- Send a chat message including your death coordinates(only to yourself)
- Custom death sound effect which can be edited with a resource pack(silent by default)
- And more!

You Were Slain was made because I wanted a Terraria-styled death screen, but it quickly spiraled into a death screen customization mod. The default settings are based on Terraria.

## Dependencies
